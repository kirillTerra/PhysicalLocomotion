# PhysicalLocomotion

This repository is a fork of [BodyTransformer](https://github.com/real-stanford/BodyTransformer), originally implementing a graph-based masking technique for structural elements.
I extend the authors‚Äô idea and introduce several new features:

1. **Exponentially decaying masks** ‚Äî allowing more flexible attention suppression.
2. **Training & testing interface** ‚Äî designed for policy learning and subsequent evaluation with full logging of intermediate attention matrices for further analysis.
3. **Custom masking based on attention analysis** ‚Äî which not only speeds up computation but also improves overall quality.
For more details, please refer to the thesis text: `Bachelor_Thesis.pdf` and the presentation: `presentation.pdf`.

The figure shows a comparison of four methods: MLP, Vanilla Transformer, Masked Transformer, and Exp Decay Transformer, each averaged over 5 runs.  
The Exp Decay Transformer demonstrates a clear dominance in performance, supporting the validity of the introduced inductive bias and indicating the right direction of research.

This repository was the foundation of my **thesis project**.
The text and presentation of my work can be found in the corresponding files inside this repo.

## Install the simulation environment

Install IsaacGym by following the instructions in the [official page](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym).
Then, install the required packages:
```
pip install -e IsaacGymEnvs
pip install -e rl_games
```

## Train the policy

To train the policy, run the following commands:
```
cd IsaacGymEnvs/isaacgymenvs
python launch.py
```
See the `launch.py` file for the available options.
